# Flight-Strike-Analysis-II

Same introduction as part I. The flying animals be really messing things up for us. They just flexing their wings and there they go boom.
The dashboard visually describes the point of impact of wildlife strikes. 

Going clockwise, the first visual shows at what altitude most of the birdy strikes occur. Most of the strikes are near the ground(0 feet). This is the usual flying elevation of the birds, the flex isn't worth the hype anyway. The second visual shows the number of strikes by airport. At the south and central locations of the country, we find the highest wildlife strikes. Texas has the highest reported strikes! Most of the attacks are by flighted animals, and very few by terrestrial mammals. 

The third one displays the phase of flights: at what phase of the flight's journey did the strikes occur. There is not any damage when the flight is stationed at the airports. The issue arises when the airplane is moving, a few cases when the plane is taxing to the runway. Most of the hits occured when the airplane is either in take off, landing or in climb/descent. The final visual shows the time of day of strikes. The strikes occur mid day when the sky is clear or at night when there is no visibility. It is surprising to see low number of strikes during dawn and dusk.  

<h2>What's the takeaway?</h2>
If you ask what's the point of this dashboard, currently it is not impactful to take the insights seriously from past data. We need new information and many more parameters such as usual flight trajectories and bird breeding seasons. The information is useful to understand high activities of these beings and how we can better protect their lives while making sure we do not bleed our engines and keep our lives at stake.

If I am bored of thinking ideas for more git repos, I will complete writing this analysis. For now this is all I have...
